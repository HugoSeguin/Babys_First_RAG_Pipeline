event name: Rattan L. Khosa SeedCon: Beyond the Hype
start time: 2026-01-30T08:00:00-06:00
end time: 2026-01-30T17:00:00-06:00
event description: <a href="https://luma.com/polsky-01-30-2026-event-1325">RSVP</a><br><br>Overview
The Rattan L. Khosa SeedCon is Chicago Booth’s flagship entrepreneurship and venture capital conference. Through keynote fireside chats, panel discussions, and various networking sessions, SeedCon provides opportunities for entrepreneurs, investors, and passionate members of the startup ecosystem to explore emerging industry themes and connect over shared ideas. With an impressive lineup of speakers, the conference extends beyond the campus and attracts a broad audience from the greater startup and investor community. Hosted by the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation in partnership with Chicago Booth’s Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital (EVC) student group, SeedCon is made possible thanks to a generous gift from Rattan L. Khosa, MBA ’79, as a part of the Rattan L. Khosa Student Entrepreneurs Program.
Beyond the Hype
In today’s fast-paced world, success isn’t just about launching—it’s about enduring. Rattan L. Khosa SeedCon 2026 Beyond the Hype is designed to spark deeper conversations that move past surface-level observations—whether in AI, CPG, or other areas of innovation. This year, we bring together trailblazing entrepreneurs, insightful investors, and seasoned operators to delve into strategies for sustainable growth, robust unit economics, and business models that stand the test of time.
Keynote Speaker
Tom Elnick | Former Cofounder & Co-CEO, Tegus; Partner, Bancroft Capital Partners
Featured Panel Topics
Energy Transition: The Invisible Engine Powering the AI era
This session addresses the massive, escalating challenge of providing the energy and physical infrastructure required to sustain the current and future AI boom. From the dramatic increase in power consumption for training LLMs to the engineering hurdles of designing ultra-efficient, highly distributed data centers, the need for novel solutions is urgent. Can sustainability and scale co-exist in the age of AI compute?
Healthcare: Innovation to Adoption - Delivering Real Patient Outcomes
From AI-assisted diagnostics to digital therapeutics, healthcare innovation is moving faster than ever. This panel will explore how startups can navigate regulation, partnerships, and capital to drive meaningful change in patient outcomes. Attendees will gain actionable insights on how to bridge cutting-edge innovation with real-world healthcare delivery.
Enterprise AI: Making AI *Actually* Work
Companies have wildly different AI readiness, and are stuck experimenting with pilots rather than actually deploying into production. This discussion brings together operators, founders, and investors who’ve seen what it takes to cross that chasm. We’ll dig into how enterprises are actually utilizing AI - what’s working, what isn’t, and where startups can find opportunity.
CPG: The Next Chapter of Chicago’s Consumer Renaissance
Chicago has long been a hub for consumer brands, from legacy brands to emerging startups reshaping how and what we buy. During this panel, we will learn what investors are looking for in the next wave of CPG startups and how founders are redefining what makes a great brand.
Global VC: Creating Lasting Value in Emerging Markets
This panel brings together investors and entrepreneurs around the world who look beyond surface-level trends to understand how regional context shapes innovation. We’ll explore how they assess local readiness and founder-market fit to identify durable, scalable opportunities.
Deep Tech: Turning Breakthroughs Into Sustainable Businesses
Deep tech isn’t built like typical startups: the science is harder, the timelines are longer, and the path from lab to market is rarely straightforward. In this panel, we will discuss how teams can turn frontier technologies into viable businesses in fields like quantum, AI, robotics, life sciences, and energy.

event description: <a href="https://luma.com/viy2o1pv">RSVP</a><br><br>The 2026 SDR Capacity Blueprint: How Top Teams Plan, Model & Scale
About the Event
Most SDR teams struggle with capacity planning because no one has perfect data, but great leaders do have one thing in common: they learn from each other.
This meetup brings together SDR leaders from across the community to openly compare notes on how they plan headcount, set realistic targets, design coverage models, and forecast SDR output for 2026.
No presentations. No slide decks.
Just real operators sharing real numbers, frameworks, and what’s actually working on the ground.
What We’ll Cover Together
How different teams structure their SDR capacity models
How leaders calculate rep productivity, coverage ratios, and meeting requirements
Benchmarks for meetings, SALs, and pipeline creation going into 2026
How teams adjust their model based on territories, ICP focus, inbound/outbound mix
Where capacity models typically break, and how other leaders avoid those pitfalls
Open discussion: share your own model (or challenge) and learn from the room
What Makes This Different
This isn’t a lecture.
The value comes from the people in the room; comparing approaches, challenging assumptions, and helping each other build more accurate, scalable models.
You’ll walk away with:
• New ways to structure your capacity model
• Benchmarks from peers in similar markets
• Real clarity you can take back to your CRO or leadership team
• A stronger network of operators solving the same problems
If you want sharper thinking and better inputs for your 2026 SDR plan, this session will deliver it.

event description: <a href="Python Office Hours  ">RSVP</a><br><br>Python Office Hours at PS1 is back. now on Mondays opposite NERP.

What is this meeting about?

https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Python_Office_Hours

This is a chance for people of all experiences levels to get together for programming, socializing, and moral support while working on things.

This is a flipped "office hours" where you can learn from your peers.

In flipped classrooms students watch lectures and read material outside the classroom then work on things in person. This isn't a formal class, but the idea is similar. Many people who attend are there to help.

If you prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too!

We talk on irc during office hours at #pumpingstationone on lebre.chat.
https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/IRC

It is handy for sharing links to information and pastebins.

If you don't already have something to work on or study, feel free to show up and see what is going on.

What to bring?

An interest in Python

A kind attitude and good conduct: Everyone is expected to Be excellent to each other (https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Be_excellent_to_each_other) at the space. On top of that, I'd like to make this a setting that follows the Recurse Center User's Manual (https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) on social rules. Their social rules make learning environments more productive and friendly. I also expect everyone to follow the Python Office Hours Code_of_Conduct (https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Python_Office_Hours/Code_of_Conduct).

A computer: We have wifi at the space, but we don't have extra computers floating around. If you have trouble bringing a laptop, talk to us before the event. We can try to find one for you but we need to know beforehand (preferably a few days).

Come see what Pumping Station: One is about. Bring your questions, enthusiasm, curiosity and maybe a friend.

Member meeting starts on at 8 pm in the lounge. Open house attendees will get a tour of the space, Q&A session and a bit of an orientation about how the space works. PS1 members generally don't RSVP for the Meetup, but hey, whatever floats your boat.

Open house attendees can meet and mingle with members after member meeting business is concluded.

Pumping Station: One identifies as a hackerspace. For more information about this and other hackerspaces, see http://www.hackerspaces.org

A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace or hackspace) is a community-operated, (often "Not For Profit" (501(c)(3) in the United States), work space where people with common interests, often in computers, machining, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, tinker, build, socialize and collaborate. Hackerspaces have also been compared to other community-operated organizations with similar aims and mechanisms such as FabLab, and commercial for-profit companies such as TechShop.

In this talk we will learn two of the most important FM perspectives: the properties that systems have and the state spaces they cover.

event name: Less Data Lake, More Data LEGO: Safer autonomy in high risk domains by simplifying the agent decision space
start time: 2025-12-09T18:00:00-06:00
end time: 2025-12-09T20:00:00-06:00
event description: <a href="https://luma.com/g8axlapt">RSVP</a><br><br>Join us as Jonathan Eyler-Werve presents his talk "Less Data Lake, More Data LEGO: Safer autonomy in high risk domains by simplifying the agent decision space"

Agentic applications vastly accelerate value discovery, but do not improve stability, accuracy and downside risks over traditional software. We will share techniques for simplifying the decision space exposed to foundation models; we believe this is the best path to value from autonomous agents in high risk domains. I’ll share insights from LLM advisory work with VMware customers in high-risk domains including trading, banking, payments, aerospace, autonomous driving, healthcare and insurance. We’ll share thoughts on security and access controls for the MCP protocol, which we contribute to, and next steps for VMware’s Spring AI framework.
